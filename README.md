# Trash Guides
[TRaSH Guides](https://trash-guides.info) is a community-driven resource offering clear, step-by-step guides for optimizing your media management tools—primarily Sonarr for TV shows and Radarr for Movies. Born from a personal quest to fine-tune quality profiles and release preferences, these guides break down complex configurations into easy-to-follow instructions, often enriched with visuals and expert tips.

A key focus of TRaSH Guides is on identifying the best [releases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirated_movie_release_types#Release_formats) and understanding the role of release groups. The guides explain how different release groups operate, which ones consistently deliver high-quality content, and how to configure your settings to prioritize those optimal releases. This in-depth approach helps ensure that your media collection is built from the most reliable and well-regarded sources available.
